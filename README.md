# Risk-Factors
Analyze MEPS data to identify socioeconomic-dependent risk factors for heart disease

This program analyzes data from the 2016 Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS) to identify socioeconomic-dependent risk factors that lead to the development of heart disease.
The intent is to determine if known heart disease risk factors like cholesterol, diabetes, smoking, and blood pressure are developed at higher rates in populations of poor socioeconomic status.
